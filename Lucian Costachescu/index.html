    <h2>
      Facing injuries and mental fatigue
    </h2>
    <p> After an amazing 2021-2022 season where Klopp's team fight for every trophy 'till the very last game, it seems the short summer holiday due to the world cup and the inujries are now the reason for the current form. Nothing seems to revitalize the team and everyone can't wait for the season to be over.
